    "## Current Issues\n",
    "The current `mf-geoadmin3` app faces some issues that need to be addressed in the (near) future:\n",
    "- end of life: angularJS (aka angular 1.X) is in LTS maintenance mode and will be discontinued in mid-2021\n",
    "- slow: the current app is slow (see e.g. [performance analysis done for MVT](https://ltboc.infra.bgdi.ch/notebooks/mvt/ol-mapbox-performance-comparison.html) which shows that a considerable amount of time is lost during startup of the app)\n",
    "- complex: despite the modularization, the current app is fairly complex (see dependency analysis below) and difficult to extend and maintain for non-angularJS experts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals for next-gen app\n",
    "The next-generation SPA should meet these goals:\n",
    "- as much framework-agnostic code as possible: the new javascript standard ES6 introduced the concept of *modules*, allowing to natively modularize JS code without the need to use a framework (which was the case in the days when angularJS was invented)\n",
    "- follow the [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview.html#content) principle: separate *state*, *logic* and *ui*\n",
    "- modern build system: webpack is the de-facto standard (or at least very widely used) used to build (compile, minify) *module*-arized JS-libs\n",
    "- local development: it should be possible to develop and serve the app locally (which comes for free when using webpack with webpack-dev-server)\n",
    "- PWA: with choosing the correct JS frameworks, PWA's and/or native apps come almost for free (e.g. ionic, vue-native, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development approach\n",
    "In principle, there exist two fundamentally different ways of how to approach development, either green-field approach or a transformation approach, both with risks and advantages. The first question that needs to be answered for both of them is whether the feature set should remain exactly the same or whether some of the existing features can be discontinued. The second question is whether development should happen in an agile manner controlled by us or as a task that is given to an external company and we'd get the final product in the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Green-field approach\n",
    "A concise spec does not exist at the moment, however there's the existing code and a test-book that cover many of the use cases. A green-field approach would offer the possibility (if done in an agile way) to start with the most simple features (e.g. show one basemap) and gradually adding features existing in the current app, thereby deciding whether or not to keep this feature. The risks with the green-field approach are that \n",
    "- the necessary effort is hard to estimate\n",
    "- we would have to 'switch' at one point\n",
    "- we would have to maintain the 'old' app while developing the new one\n",
    "- we would potentially have to add features to the old app and the new one -> moving target\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformation approach\n",
    "The biggest advantage of the transformation approach is that there's always a production-ready version of the app available. The transformation approach would implicitly require a careful analysis of the existing code, minimizing the risk of 'hidden' business logic being lost. The disadvantage is that some extra work and code overhead is required due to the transformation.\n",
